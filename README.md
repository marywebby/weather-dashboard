# weather-dashboard

DESCRIPTION 

The following application provided can help you check the weather of any city in the world! When you type in the city you are looking for in the search bar you are given its current temperature, wind speed, and humidity for that day, and the next following 5 days! Also, any previous city you have looked up will appear in a list below, so you are able to see which cities you have looked up before. This challenge gave me a really good insight on how to use a weather API and integrate it into different programs I may use in the future. I also got good practice at making cards in javascript to load when I am imputting the data from the API into the code.
