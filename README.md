# weather-dashboard

DESCRIPTION 

The following application provided can help you check the weather of any city in the world! When you type in the city you are looking for in the search bar you are given its current temperature, wind speed, and humidity for that day, and the next following 5 days! Also, any previous city you have looked up will appear in a list below, so you are able to see which cities you have looked up before. This challenge gave me a really good insight on how to use a weather API and integrate it into different programs I may use in the future. I also got good practice at making cards in javascript to load when I am imputting the data from the API into the code. 


USAGE 

So when you first load the page, you will be presented with this page

You will then input a city name and then press the search button

If you click search without an input you will be presented with a pop that will tell you to input a city

You can also click on any previous searches you have inputted for easy access!

and finally once you have decided on the city you will be presented with the current forcast, and the forcast for the following 5 days!
